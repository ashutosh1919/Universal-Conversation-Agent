Objective : To create a conversation agent, which can talk about any context.

I have used Recurrent Neural Network model to make our ChatBot understand the English sentences properly.
I have also used AIML files, which is Rule Based approach for creating Chatbots.

I have tried to merge both probabilistic (RNN model) and rule based (AIML) approach in this project.

RNN model consists following parameters.

I have deployed my Chatbot on Facebook Messanger, Telegram, Custom Android App, Custom Website.
The screenshot of custome android app is attached below.
